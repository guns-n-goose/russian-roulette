## About the game

>Did you ever hear of Russian Roulette?' When I said I had not, he told me all about it. When he was with the Russian army in Rumania, around 1917, and things were cracking up, so that their officers felt that they were not only losing prestige, money, family, and country, but were being also dishonored before their colleagues of the Allied armies, some officer would suddenly pull out his revolver, anywhere, at the table, in a caf√©, at a gathering of friends, remove a cartridge from the cylinder, spin the cylinder, snap it back in place, put it to his head and pull the trigger. There were five chances to one that the hammer would set off a live cartridge and blow his brains all over the place.

~ Georges Surdez 1937

## Game instructions

At the beginning a player has to choose how many bullets he will load into the cylinder. He may choose any between 1 and 5. 
He will then have the option to either shoot or cash out his earnings. 

Note that after every shot the cylinder is spun again - we want to give everyone a fair chance.
